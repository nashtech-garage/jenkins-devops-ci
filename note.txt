Loading resources:
External libraries may load adjunct files from a resources/ directory using the libraryResource step. The argument is a relative pathname, akin to Java resource loading:

def request = libraryResource 'com/mycorp/pipeline/somelib/request.json'


Only entire pipelines can be defined in shared libraries as of this time. This can only be done in vars/*.groovy, and only in a call method. Only one Declarative Pipeline can be executed in a single build, and if you attempt to execute a second one, your build will fail as a result.
